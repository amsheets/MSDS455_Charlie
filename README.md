# MSDS455_Charlie
Team Charlie was tasked with creating a presentation within the Health/Fitness arena.  As such, we decided to explore the details behind heart disease prevention. Heart disease is a deadly condition that can affect everyone and is preventable by making good life choices. “The show” will explain what heart disease is, why we should care about it, and what we can do about it. We used several studies that illustrate that there is a great deal we can do to reduce our chances of contracting heart disease. If we are aware and make sound decisions about what we do with and what we put into our bodies, then we can eliminate heart disease as the number one killer in the world.

The goal of this project was to create an HTML presentation using R, Gephi and/or Tableau leveraging the visualization best practices learned during our MSDS 455 - Data Visualization course.
